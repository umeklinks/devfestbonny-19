# Devfestbonny-19

This is a simple HTML Page for GDG Bonny Island Event Template that's open for contributions. It made use of `HTML, CSS $ SCSS, and JAVASCRIPT` 
You can fork it and customize to your test.

However, the project is hard coded. The `footer, & partners` are being duplicated in all the HTML pages which is not recommended 
so please make sure to edit them in all pages. I will refactor it soon to make it standard and flexible. 

Feel free to contribute to make it easy for others to use. It is open for everyone to use.

I used firebase database as the backend.

If you have any questions please do free to contact and waiting for your contributions.

Thanks a lot.
